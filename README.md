Welcome to Sharon Greenblatt's Final Project for Software Design!

In order to run this program, you need to clone the project.
Then go into the src folder.
Find the Game package and then the Game class and run the main method.

This will allow you to play the game in your IDE. This is a text based game so it does require you to enter commands.

The rules of the game are as follows:
  * On your turn, you must select at least one and up to 4 cards you want to play
    * If the game as has just started or Cheat! Was called on the player before you, you can play any number card you wish
    * Otherwise, you must play cards that are either one value below, of equal value, or one value above of the cards played last
  * You can lie about what cards you are playing and do not have to choose all the same card
  * If you are lying and are accused by an opponent, you have to pick up the Pile and add it to your hand
  * If you are telling the truth and have been accused, your opponent has to pick up the Pile and add it to their hand
  * The last two rules also apply for when you accuse an opponent of cheating
